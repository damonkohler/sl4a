# Latest Python #
The development of Python for Android has moved to here:
http://github.com/kuri65536/python-for-android/

Older versions of Python would not cope properly with hashlib and other modules
with shared library dependencies on Gingerbread (2.3) and above. Also, new
versions of Python have much better support for external modules.

### Notes for Java interpreters ###
Beanshell and Rhino can both directly access the android api. However, many
Android api calls required a context, which, due to the way they are run, these
interpreters don't have. A solution is being sought... suggestions appreciated.

# Honeycomb remix #

[SL4A for Honeycomb](http://www.greenhughes.com/content/sl4a-tablet-remix-release-announcement)
