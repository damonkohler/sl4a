**Note:** The new interpreter API is in **DRAFT**.

## Introduction ##

Part of the SL4A project is to define an API for others to develop new
interpreters that SL4A (or any other compatible project) can support. Currently,
this standard is for interpreters that can be run as a binary in a separate
process. This standard will be extended in the future to also support running
JVM based interpreters in process.

  * [The Easy Way](#way1) is a step-by-step description of how to
    build an interpreter APK that is compatible with SL4A.
  * [The Way of Samurai](#way2) describes how to use the
    [interpreter.jar](../android/InterpreterForAndroidTemplate/libs/interpreter.jar)
    in your own project to interface with SL4A.
  * [The Way of Zen](#way3) describes the API in detail.

## <a name="way1"></a> The Easy Way ##

Everything that is required for creating a simple interpreter APK is provided in
the template project:
  * an activity with an install/uninstall button,
  * an interpreter installer and uninstaller,
  * a zip file downloader and extractor,
  * and a content provider that describes how to use the interpreter.

  1. Download this project: `git clone git://github.com/kuri65536/sl4a`
  1. Import the template project into Eclipse: `File > Import > Existing
     Projects into Workspace`, click on `Select archive file` and fill in the
     path to your copy of interpreter\_for\_android\_template.zip.
  1. Set the ANDROID\_SDK variable, as described in the
     [compilation instructions](CompilingASE.md).
  1. Build the project. If Eclipse complains that gen folder is missing and/or
     there are build path errors, Clean/Build/Refresh should solve the problem.
  1. Rename the project and the default package `com.dummy.fooforandroid ->
     your_package_name` (we suggest using `Refactor > Rename`). It is important
     that this is unique because SL4A uses package names to identify
     interpreters.

  1. Update the 'package' property in AndroidManifest.xml
     `package="your_package_name"`.
  1. Rename the main activity `FooMain -> Your_Activity_Name`.
  1. Update `android:name` activity property in the AndroidManifest.xml
     `<activity android:name=".Your_Activity_Name">`.
  1. Change `android:mimeType` property of intent-filter in the
     AndroidManifest.xml `<data
        android:mimeType="script/.Your_interpreter_file_extension"/>`.
  1. Rename the content provider `FooProvider -> Your_Provider_Name`.
  1. Update `android:name` and `android:authorities` provider properties in the
     AndroidManifest.xml `<provider android:name=".Your_Provider_Name"`,
     `android:authorities="your_package_name.your_provider_name">`.
  1. Rename the application `res > values > strings.xml > app_name`.
  1. Update the [interpreter description](#impl_desc).
  1. Update the [interpreter provider](../tree/master/android/InterpreterForAndroid/src/com/googlecode/android_scripting/interpreter/InterpreterProvider.java).
  1. If your interpreter requires any additional setup up as part of the
     installation (e.g., creating temp/cache folders), you can do that in the
     installer's [setup method](../android/PythonForAndroid/src/com/googlecode/pythonforandroid/PythonInstaller.java).
  1. Well behaved interpreters should clean up after themselves in the
     uninstaller cleanup method.
  1. Export your project as an APK, install it, and check that SL4A discovers
     your new interpreter.

### Creating Your Interpreter Archives ###

SL4A interpreters are distributed in up to three zip files:

  * xxxx\_rxx.zip will be extracted to internal memory. This zip contains files
    that must be marked as executable. This is not possible in external storage
    space.

  * xxxx\_extras\_rxx.zip will be extracted to external storage. Tis zip
    contains files that don't need to be marked as executable. As much of the
    interpreter as possible should be included in this zip in order to avoid
    taking up unnecessary space in internal memory. However, there are security
    implications associated with using external storage since any user or
    process can alter the data there.

  * xxxx\_scripts\_rxx.zip will be extracted to the scripts folder. This zip
    contains example scripts.

When creating an interpreter archive (xxxx\_rxx.zip and xxxx\_extras\_rxx.zip),
make sure that it contains a single folder with all of the files inside, the
name of this folder has to match the name of the interpreter (as returned by
descriptor's getName()). Script archives should contain a single folder named
"scripts" with all of the example scripts inside.

## <a name="way2"></a> The Way of Samurai ##

If your project doesn't require the functionality provided by the interpreter
template project, or you want to write you own installer, uninstaller, etc. from
scratch, you can use the
[interpreter.jar](../tree/master/android/InterpreterForAndroidTemplate/libs/interpreter.jar).
  1. Add a `libs` folder to your project and copy interpreter.jar into it.
  1. Right-click on the project `> Properties > Java Build Path` and go to
     `Libraries` tab.
  1. Click on `Add JARs...`, select `your_project/libs/interpreter.jar` and
     click `OK`.

The jar contains the `Utils` and `InterpreterForAndroid` projects from
[the SL4A repository](../tree/master/android).
Instead of using the jar, you can checkout these projects from the repository
and add them directly to your project's `Java Build Path > Projects`. Be sure to
set the `ANDROID_SDK` variable as described in
[Compiling SL4A](CompilingASE.md).

In order for SL4A to discover your interpreter, add the following intent-filter
to the main activity in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```
  <intent-filter>
    <action
      android:name="com.googlecode.android_scripting.DISCOVER_INTERPRETERS"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
    <data android:mimeType="script/.Your_interpreter_file_extension"/>
  </intent-filter>
```

Additionally, broadcast an intent in the following way to notify SL4A that your
interpreter has been installed or uninstalled:
```
  Intent intent = new Intent();
  String id = "you_package_name";  // e.g. getClass().getPackage().getName().
  intent.setData(Uri.parse("package:" + id));  // SL4A uses "package" DataScheme
  if (isInterpreterInstalled) {
      // Interpreter was successfully installed.
      intent.setAction(InterpreterConstants.ACTION_INTERPRETER_ADDED);
  } else {
      // Interpreter was uninstalled.
      intent.setAction(InterpreterConstants.ACTION_INTERPRETER_REMOVED);
  }
  // ...
  sendBroadcast(intent);
```

Finally, make sure to provide an [interpreter descriptor](#impl_desc) and extend
[InterpreterProvider](../tree/master/android/InterpreterForAndroid/src/com/googlecode/android_scripting/interpreter/InterpreterProvider.java)
with your own implementation.

## <a name="way3"></a> The Way of Zen ##

If you decide to create an interpreter APK completely from scratch, here are
several things you'll need to do in order to be compatible with SL4A:

  * In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, declare an intent-filter with
    `com.googlecode.android_scripting.DISCOVER_INTERPRETERS` action as described
    above [above](#way2).

  * Declare and implement a content provider:
    * Make sure the authority is `your_package_name.provider_name`.
    * The provider needs to have three tables:
      `com.googlecode.android_scripting.base`,
      `com.googlecode.android_scripting.env` and
      `com.googlecode.android_scripting.args`.

    * On receiving a query for `com.googlecode.android_scripting.base`, the
      provider should respond with a single row cursor that contains all the
      column names defined in
      [InterpreterPropertyNames](../android/Utils/src/com/googlecode/android_scripting/interpreter/InterpreterPropertyNames.java)
      (see also  [how to implement an interpreter
      descriptor](#Implementing_the_Interpreter_Descriptor.md)).

    * On receiving a query for `com.googlecode.android_scripting.env`, the
      response should be a single row cursor where each column's name represents
      an environment variable name and each column's data containing the value
      of the variable (for example, see
      [PythonProvider](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/source/browse/android/PythonForAndroid/src/com/googlecode/pythonforandroid/PythonProvider.java)).

    * In case the query is for `com.googlecode.android_scripting.args`, the
      response is a single row cursor with values representing command line
      arguments requred to execute your interpreter (make sure that the order of
      values in the cursor is consistent with order of arguments in the command
      line).

  * Send a broadcast intent when the interpreter is added or removed as
    described [above](#The_Way_of_Samurai.md).

## <a name="impl_desc"></a> Implementing the Interpreter Descriptor ##

The interpreter descriptor provides interpreter details (e.g. name, file
extension, etc.), installation details (e.g. the location of the interpreter
archive) and execution information (e.g. binary path and arguments). See the
[InterpreterDescriptor](../tree/master/android/Utils/src/com/googlecode/android_scripting/interpreter/InterpreterDescriptor.java)
class.

In order for the default installer to find your archives, location values
returned by the getInterpreterArchiveUrl(), getExtrasArchiveUrl() and
getScriptsArchiveUrl() should follow normal URL syntax.

## Android Proxy RPC Client ##

RPC API, server, AP\_PORT, AP\_HOST, etc.

### RPC Authentication ###

SL4A enforces per-script security sandboxing by requiring all scrits to be
authenticated by the corresponding RPC server. In order for the authentication
to succeed, a script has to send the correct handshake secret to the
corresponding server. This is accomplished by:

  1. reading the `AP_HANDSHAKE` environment variable
  1. and then calling the RPC method `_authenticate` with the value of
     `AP_HANDSHAKE` as an argument.

The `_authenticate` method must be the _first_ RPC call and should take place
during the initialization of the Android library (for example, see
[Rhino's](../tree/lang-rhino/rhino/ase/android.js)
or
[Python's](../../python-for-android/tree/master/python-build/python-libs/ase/android.py)
Android module).
