Only shell is included with the ASE install. Other interpreters must be
installed separately. To add another interpreter:

  1. Press the menu button
  1. Tap "View"
  1. Tap "Interpreters"
  1. Press the menu button
  1. Tap "Add"
  1. Select the interpreter you would like to install

The selected interpreter will be downloaded via the Android web browser. Once
it's finished downloading, tap the download notification to start the
installation process as you would for any other downloaded APK.

After installing the interpreter APK, start it and tap the "Install" button. The
interpreter, interpreter extras, and example scripts (if available) will be
downloaded to /sdcard/xxx.zip and then extracted to
/data/data/com.googlecode.android\_scripting/files/xxx, /sdcard/sl4a/extras/xxx,
and /sdcard/sl4a/scripts respectively.

If you experience problems while installing interpreters:
  1. Check that your network connection is working by trying to load a web page
     in your browser.
  1. Try to add the interpreter again. SL4A should recover from most
     installation failures.
  1. Uninstall and reinstall the interpreter. You can uninstall the interpreter
     through the "Manage applications" menu in your device's settings.

### Troubleshooting ###

  * I tried to install an interpreter but I still only see "No scripts!" in the
    script manager.

> It's likely that the installation failed. Try again.

  * SL4A reported that "Extracting xxx failed."

> Delete all ZIP files from /sdcard and then try the installation again.

  * It still doesn't work! Please [file a bug](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/Issues?tm=3).
