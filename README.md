#Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A)

SL4A brings scripting languages to Android by allowing you to edit and execute
scripts and interactive interpreters directly on the Android device. These
scripts have access to many of the APIs available to full-fledged Android
applications, but with a greatly simplified interface that makes it easy to get
things are done.

Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal and in the background.  Python,
Perl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell, JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported,
and we're planning to add more. See the [SL4A Video
Help](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B) playlist on
YouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.

SL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software.
