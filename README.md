Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) brings scripting languages to Android by
allowing you to edit and execute scripts and interactive interpreters directly
on the Android device. These scripts have access to many of the APIs available
to full-fledged Android applications, but with a greatly simplified interface
that makes it easy to get things done.

Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal, in the background. Python,
Perl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell, JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported,
and we're planning to add more. See the [SL4A Video Help](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B)
playlist on
YouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.

SL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software.
Please report bugs and feature requests on the [issues list](../../issues).

You can download the current APK by scanning or clicking the following barcode:

##Disclaimer

  * Even though a lot of contributors are working for Google, this is not an
    official Google product.
  * SL4A is no longer under active development. However, some forks of this
    project may be.

##Documentation

The original Google Code wiki has been converted to Markdown and
is available in the [docs folder](docs/).
A few of the most important pages are:

  * [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)
  * [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md)
  * [API Reference](docs/ApiReference.md)
  * [Tutorials](docs/Tutorials.md) ... it is a little old but useful for start.
  * [damonkholer documents archive from googlecode](https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a/tree/wiki)

## What's Powered by SL4A? ##

Want to see SL4A in action? Check out some of these cool SL4A powered projects:

### Rockets ###

SL4A was used by the Nexus One payload for sensor logging.
See the [article in Make](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/07/nexus_onearduino_smallsat_satellite.html)
for more information about the project.

[rockets2]:http://img.youtube.com/vi/nSyWDqgNRmo/0.jpg


### Cellbots ###

We are a collection of hobbyists who want to free your cell phone
from your pocket and let it connect and move with the real world. How?
As a robot of course!

Cellbots aren't just about using your phone to control a
robot (which is cool too), but we aim on making your phone be the robot.

It already has touch, hearing, speech, vibration, and many more senses,
but needs legs (or wheels) to finally be the free roaming robot it was
born to be.

See the [Cellbots blog](http://www.cellbots.com/) or
[YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/cellbots) for more.


### Oplop ###

Using a single master password and various account names,
one can create an infinite number of unique account passwords.

These unique account passwords are commonly called password hashes,
domain-specific passwords, or per-site passwords.

See the [Oplop](http://code.google.com/p/oplop/) project page
for more information.


### Broadcast ###

Broadcast is an embedded web application for remote Android device management.
Broadcast has four goals:

  * Remote monitoring:  Make Android state and device data available over a network.
  * Remote control:  Allow remote control of an Android device over a network.
  * Proof-of-concept:  Demonstrate that complex ruby applications can run in
    an Android environment, even with constrained resources.
  * Framework:  Set the groundwork for a number of advanced applications.

See [the project homepage](http://github.com/mleone/broadcast/), this
[presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/panopticdev/broadcast-presentation),
and this [screenshot](http://i52.tinypic.com/w9zfh4.jpg) for more information.


### SMS Merger ###

SMS Merger is an excellent example of what can be done with Python and
the WebView API.
SMS Merger is designed to send a series of personalized SMS. For example,
to let Antony, Bob and Claire know which seat number they have been
allocated for their exams, SMS Merger can turn a CSV file into
the following SMS messages:

```
Dear Antony, your seat is A1
Dear Bob, your seat is M4
Dear Claire, your seat is M2
```

Eclipse
---
* Clone this project, and import it into Eclipse. Make sure that the Java compliance
level is at 1.6 (right-click any project, go to Properties > Java Compiler > Configure Workspace Settings
and select 1.6.

* Make sure that you have all the appropriate Android SDKs installed through Eclipse. You can determine
this by looking at what errors prop up.

* Make sure the environment variable ANDROID\_SDK is set, by going to Window > Preferences > Java >
