This application generates API documentation.

To compile RpcDoclet in Eclipse, go to Windows-->Preferences-->Java-->Build Path-->Classpath Variables

Add "JDK" and point it to a valid jdk environment (ie, C:\program files\java\jdk1.6.0_11)

RpcDoclet needs to be able to find "lib/tools.jar" to compile.

TextDocumentationGenerator creates a wiki version of the current API Reference (suitable for the code.google.com wiki) - run it, then cut and paste the console output into your wiki page.

RpcDoclet is a javadoc add on that combines javadoc and Rpc annotations into a more detailled API reference. 

To build the onboard api help, run: javadoc.xml as an ant build. You may need to modify the ant environment variables to tell it where to find javadoc.exe if it isn't in the path.
ie:
javadoc.xml-->Run as-->Ant Build...-->Environment Variables-->New-->PATH C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;${env_var:Path}

This will create a doc folder with the api help html files, and zip these into ../ScriptingLayerForAndroid/assets/sl4adoc.zip
