      <h3>Version 1.1.12 / 2009-01-11</h3>
<p>
WARNING: there was a stub/mock bug in 1.1.11 that allowed a structure that
was not intended:
</p>
<pre>
  obj.stub!(:msg)
  obj.msg
  obj.should_receive(:msg)
</pre>
<p>
That would pass in 1.1.11, but should not have been allowed to, since the
message is received before the expectation is set. This was reported (637)
and fixed for release 1.1.12, but may cause unexpected failures if you had
examples set up as above.
</p>
<p>
WARNING: mock.should_receive(:msg).with(an_instance_of(klass)) now
correctly uses instance_of? instead of kind_of?. This may break some
existing code examples, but the fix is to just use kind_of instead of
an_instance_of
</p>
<ul>
<li>3 deprecations

<ul>
<li>deprecated ExampleMethods#implementation_backtrace - use
ExampleMethods#backtrace instead

</li>
<li>deprecated ExampleGroupMethods#example_group_backtrace - use
ExampleGroupMethods#backtrace instead

</li>
<li>deprecated Spec::Example::BehaviourRunner class (likely that nobody is
using this)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 major enhancements

<ul>
<li>it { should matcher } - support for implicit receiver of should (Joe Ferris
of thoughtbot)

</li>
<li>subject { &#8230; } - works in conjunction with implicit receiver of should

</li>
<li>wrap_expectation (for wrapping multiple expectations and/or t/u assertions)

</li>
<li>added array.should =~ [1,2,3] # passes if array contains exactly the same
elements in any order (Jeff Dean and Pat Maddox)

</li>
<li>hash_including mock argument matcher can now accept just keys, key/value
pairs, or both (David Krmpotic)

</li>
<li>added hash_not_including mock argument matcher (David Krmpotic). Closes
634.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>9 minor enhancements

<ul>
<li>should throw_symbol accepts an optional argument: should throw_symbol(:sym,
arg)

</li>
<li>fixed &#8212;line for jruby (Zach Moazeni)

</li>
<li>assorted small changes to support Ruby 1.9 (got a way to go)

</li>
<li>removed all instances of class &lt;&lt; self - I do know who I am

</li>
<li>SpecParser can&#8216;t handle backtrace paths with colons (John-Mason P.
Shackelford). Closes 505.

</li>
<li>html formatter (and subsequently the textmate formatter) header fills in
completely when running a single example

</li>
<li>config.include now accepts an array of types (config.include(Helpers, :type
=&gt; [:view, :controller]))

</li>
<li>added be_a and be_an expectation matchers

</li>
<li>added instance_of and kind_of mock argument matchers

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>9 bug fixes

<ul>
<li>fixed bug where {:a =&gt; 1, :b =&gt; 2}.should include(:a, :b) failed
(Yossef Mendelssohn)

</li>
<li>only try to load <a href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> if <a
href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> is defined (not just <a
href="../classes/Test.html">Test</a>)

</li>
<li>Allow stubs on parent and child classes simultaneously (Jim Lindley). Fixes
600.

</li>
<li>BaseTextFormatter will now create the directory in a WHERE string (Adam
Anderson). Fixes 616.

</li>
<li>Removed incorrect -S flag on autospec commands. Added explicit spec command
for ruby to run, guarantee running rspec (raggi). Closes 507.

</li>
<li>Check whether test/unit has really been loaded before calling a method it
defines (Brian Donovan). Closes 503.

</li>
<li>Fix spec_path for shared groups (Zach Dennis). Closes 615.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.5 / 2008-09-28</h3>
<p>
IMPORTANT: use the new &#8216;autospec&#8217; command instead of
&#8216;autotest&#8217;. We changed the way autotest discovers rspec so the
autotest executable won&#8216;t automatically load rspec anymore. This
allows rspec to live side by side other spec frameworks without always
co-opting autotest through autotest&#8216;s discovery mechanism.
</p>
<p>
ALSO IMPORTANT: $rspec_options is gone. If you were using this for anything
(like your own runners), use Spec::Runner.options instead.
</p>
<p>
ADDITIONALLY IMPORTANT: If you have any custom formatters, you&#8216;ll
need to modify example_pending to accept three arguments instead of just
two. See the rdoc for
Spec::Runner::Formatter::BaseFormatter#example_pending for more
information.
</p>

Kaiser). Closes 230.

</li>
<li>make sure consolidate_failures only grabs _spec files. Closes 369

</li>
<li>Simplifying ExampleGroupMethods#registration_backtrace. (From Wilson
Bilkovich - <a
href="http://metaclass.org/2008/6/7/calling-in-the-dark">metaclass.org/2008/6/7/calling-in-the-dark</a>)

Strother). Closes 486.

up 501.

</li>
<li>mock(:null_object=&gt;true) plays nice with HTML (patch from Gerrit Kaiser)

</li>

</li>
<li>Add 2nd arg to respond_to? to align w/ core Ruby rdoc: <a

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.0-RC1</h3>
<p>
Textmate Bundle users - this release adds a new RSpec bundle that
highlights describe, it, before and after and provides navigation to
descriptions and examples (rather than classes and methods). When you first
install this, it is going to try to hijack all of your .rb files. All you
need to do is open a .rb file that does not end with &#8216;spec.rb&#8217;
and change the bundle selection from RSpec to Ruby. TextMate will do the
right thing from then on.
</p>
<p>
Shortcuts for tab-activated snippets all follow the TextMate convention of
2 or 3 letters of the first word, followed by the first letter of each
subsequent word. So &quot;should have_at_least&quot; would be triggered by
shhal.
</p>
<p>
We reduced the scope for running spec directories, files, a single file or
individual spec in TextMate to source.ruby.rspec. This allowed us to
restore the standard Ruby shortcuts:
</p>
<p>
CMD-R runs all the specs in one file CMD-SHIFT-R runs an individual spec
CMD-OPT-R runs any files or directories selected in the TextMate drawer
</p>
<p>
rspec_on_rails users - don&#8216;t forget to run script/generate rspec
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added shared_examples_for method, which you can (should) use instead of
describe Foo, :shared =&gt; true

</li>
<li>Applied LH[168] Fix describe <a href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>,
&quot;description contains a # in it&quot; (Patch from Martin Emde)

<h3>Version 1.0.8</h3>
<p>
Another bugfix release - this time to resolve the version mismatch
</p>
<h3>Version 1.0.7</h3>
<p>
Quick bugfix release to ensure that you don&#8216;t have to have the rspec
gem installed in order to use autotest with rspec_on_rails.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed [13015] autotest gives failure in &#8216;spec_command&#8217; after
upgrade 1.0.5 to 1.0.6

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.6</h3>
<p>
The &quot;holy cow, batman, it&#8216;s been a long time since we released
and there are a ton of bug fixes, patches and even new features&quot;
release.
</p>
<p>
Warning: Spec::Rails users: In fixing 11508, we&#8216;ve removed the
raise_controller_errors method. As long as you follow the upgrade
instructions and run &#8216;script/generate rspec&#8217; you&#8216;ll be
fine, but if you skip this step you need to manually go into spec_helper.rb
and remove the call to that method (if present - it might not be if you
haven&#8216;t upgraded in a while).
</p>
<p>
Warning: Implementors of custom formatters. Formatters will now be sent an
Example object instead of just a <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a> for example_started,
example_passed and example_failed. In certain scenarios (Spec::Ui with
Spec::Distributed), the formatter must ask the Example for its sequence
number instead of keeping track of a sequence number internal to the
formatter. Most of you shouldn&#8216;t need to upgrade your formatters
though - the Example#to_s method returns the example name/description, so
you should be able to use the passed Example instance as if it were a <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied [12986] <a href="../classes/Autotest.html">Autotest</a> Specs +
Refactoring (Patch from Scott Tayler)

from Carl Porth)

href="../classes/String.html">String</a> for certain methods

attributes can now be procs, which allows for lazy evaluation.

<p>
This release introduces massive improvements to Spec::Ui - the user
interface functional testing extension to RSpec. There are also some minor
bug fixes to the RSpec core.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Massive improvements to Spec::Ui. Complete support for all Watir&#8216;s

&quot;SomeType#message&quot; (likewise for &#8217;.&#8217;)

commandline args

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.9.1</h3>
<p>
This release introduces describe and it (aliased as context and specify for
backwards compatibility). This allows you to express specs like this:
</p>
<pre>
  describe SomeClass do # Creates a Behaviour
    it &quot;should do something&quot; do # Creates an Example
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The command line features four new options that give you more control over
what specs are being run and in what order. This can be used to verify that
your specs are independent (by running in opposite order with
&#8212;reverse). It can also be used to cut down feedback time by running
the most recently modified specs first (&#8212;loadby mtime
&#8212;reverse).
</p>
<p>
Further, &#8212;example replaces the old &#8212;spec option, and it can now
take a file name of spec names as an alternative to just a spec name. The
&#8212;format failing_examples:file.txt option allows you to output an
&#8212;example compatible file, which makes it possible to only rerun the
specs that failed in the last run. Spec::Rails uses all of these four
options by default to optimise your RSpec experience.
</p>
<p>
There is now a simple configuration model. For Spec::Rails, you do
something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'
  end
</pre>
<p>
You can now use mocha or flexmock with RSpec if you prefer either to
RSpec&#8216;s own mock framework. Just put this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :mocha
  end
</pre>
<p>
or this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :flexmock
  end
</pre>
<p>
in a file that is loaded before your specs. You can also configure included
modules and predicate_matchers:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include SomeModule
    config.predicate_matchers[:does_something?] = :do_something
  end
</pre>
<p>
See Spec::DSL::Behaviour for more on predicate_matchers

</p>
<h3>Version 0.8.1</h3>
<p>
Quick &quot;in house&quot; bug-fix
</p>
<h3>Version 0.8.0</h3>
<p>
This release introduces a new approach to handling expectations using
Expression Matchers.

for more info.
</p>
<p>

making it possible to store command line options in a file. This means a
more flexible RSpec experience with Rails, Rake and editor plugins like
TextMate.
</p>
<p>
It also sports myriad new features, bug fixes, patches and general

<h3>Version 0.7.0</h3>
<p>
This is the &quot;Grow up and eat your own dog food release&quot;. RSpec is
now used on itself and we&#8216;re no longer using <a
href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> to test it. Although, we
are still extending <a href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> for
the rails plugin (indirectly - through ZenTest)
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE IS NOT 100% BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE TO 0.6.x
</p>
<p>
There are a few changes that will require that you change your existing
specs.
</p>
<p>
RSpec now handles equality exactly like ruby does:
</p>
<p>
# actual.should_equal(expected) will pass if actual.equal?(expected)
returns true # actual.should eql(expected) will pass if
actual.eql?(expected) returns true # actual.should == expected will pass if
actual == expected) returns true
</p>
<p>
At the high level, eql? implies equivalence, while equal? implies object
identity. For more information on how ruby deals w/ equality, you should do
this:
</p>
<p>
ri equal?
</p>
<p>
or look at this:
</p>
<p>
<a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057">www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, we left in should_be as a synonym for should_equal, so the only specs
that should break are the ones using should_equal (which used to use
<tt>==</tt> instead of <tt>.equal?</tt>).
</p>
<p>
Lastly, should_be used to handle true and false differently from any other
values. We&#8216;ve removed this special handling, so now actual.should_be
true will fail for any value other than true (it used to pass for any
non-nil, non-false value), and actual.should_be false will fail for any
value other than false (it used to pass for nil or false).
</p>
<p>
Here&#8216;s what you&#8216;ll need to do to update your specs: # search
for &quot;should_equal&quot; and replace with &quot;should_eql&quot; # run
specs
</p>
<p>
If any specs still fail, they are probably related to should be_true or
should_be_false using non-boolean values. Those you&#8216;ll just have to
inspect manually and adjust appropriately (sorry!).
