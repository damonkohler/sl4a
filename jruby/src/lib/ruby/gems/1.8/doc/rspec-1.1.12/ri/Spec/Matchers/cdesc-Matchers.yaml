- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'RSpec ships with a number of useful Expression Matchers. An Expression Matcher
    is any object that responds to the following methods:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  matches?(actual)\n  failure_message\n  negative_failure_message #optional\n\
    \  description #optional\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: See Spec::Expectations to learn how to use these as Expectation Matchers.
    See Spec::Mocks to learn how to use them as Mock Argument Constraints.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H 
  level: 2
  text: Predicates
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In addition to those Expression Matchers that are defined explicitly, RSpec
    will create custom Matchers on the fly for any arbitrary predicate, giving your
    specs a much more natural language feel.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A Ruby predicate is a method that ends with a &quot;?&quot; and returns true
    or false. Common examples are +empty?+, +nil?+, and +instance_of?+.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'All you need to do is write +should be_+ followed by the predicate without
    the question mark, and RSpec will figure it out from there. For example:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  [].should be_empty =&gt; [].empty? #passes\n  [].should_not be_empty =&gt; \
    [].empty? #fails\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'In addtion to prefixing the predicate matchers with &quot;be_&quot;, you
    can also use &quot;be_a_&quot; and &quot;be_an_&quot;, making your specs read
    much more naturally:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &quot;a string&quot;.should be_an_instance_of(String) =&gt;&quot;a string&quot;.instance_of?(String) \
    #passes\n\n  3.should be_a_kind_of(Fixnum) =&gt; 3.kind_of?(Numeric) #passes\n\
    \  3.should be_a_kind_of(Numeric) =&gt; 3.kind_of?(Numeric) #passes\n  3.should \
    be_an_instance_of(Fixnum) =&gt; 3.instance_of?(Fixnum) #passes\n  3.should_not \
    be_instance_of(Numeric) =&gt; 3.instance_of?(Numeric) #fails\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'RSpec will also create custom matchers for predicates like +has_key?+. To
    use this feature, just state that the object should have_key(:key) and RSpec will
    call has_key?(:key) on the target. For example:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  {:a =&gt; &quot;A&quot;}.should have_key(:a) =&gt; {:a =&gt; &quot;A&quot;}.has_key?(:a) \
    #passes\n  {:a =&gt; &quot;A&quot;}.should have_key(:b) =&gt; {:a =&gt; &quot;A&quot;}.has_key?(:b) \
    #fails\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You can use this feature to invoke any predicate that begins with &quot;has_&quot;,
    whether it is part of the Ruby libraries (like +Hash#has_key?+) or a method you
    wrote on your own class.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H 
  level: 2
  text: Custom Expectation Matchers
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When you find that none of the stock Expectation Matchers provide a natural
    feeling expectation, you can very easily write your own.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'For example, imagine that you are writing a game in which players can be
    in various zones on a virtual board. To specify that bob should be in zone 4,
    you could say:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  bob.current_zone.should eql(Zone.new(&quot;4&quot;))\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'But you might find it more expressive to say:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  bob.should be_in_zone(&quot;4&quot;)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: and/or
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  bob.should_not be_in_zone(&quot;3&quot;)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'To do this, you would need to write a class like this:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  class BeInZone\n    def initialize(expected)\n      @expected = expected\n\
    \    end\n    def matches?(target)\n      @target = target\n      @target.current_zone.eql?(Zone.new(@expected))\n\
    \    end\n    def failure_message\n      &quot;expected #{@target.inspect} to be \
    in Zone #{@expected}&quot;\n    end\n    def negative_failure_message\n      &quot;expected \
    #{@target.inspect} not to be in Zone #{@expected}&quot;\n    end\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: '... and a method like this:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  def be_in_zone(expected)\n    BeInZone.new(expected)\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'And then expose the method to your specs. This is normally done by including
    the method and the class in a module, which is then included in your spec:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  module CustomGameMatchers\n    class BeInZone\n      ...\n    end\n\n  \
    \  def be_in_zone(expected)\n      ...\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe &quot;Player \
    behaviour&quot; do\n    include CustomGameMatchers\n    ...\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'or you can include in globally in a spec_helper.rb file <tt>require</tt>d
    from your spec file(s):'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    config.include(CustomGameMatchers)\n\
    \  end\n"
